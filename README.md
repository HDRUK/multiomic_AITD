We study:

1) Association between IgG N-glycan traits and immune cell traits

    a) We observed that there is a complementarity between IgG core fucose levels and a subpopulation of natural killer (NK) cells in the general population 
    
    b) folder "glycanTraits_immuneCellTraits" 
    
2) Association between IgG N-glycan traits and secreted serum proteins

    a) We observed that the serum profile of IgG N-glycan is also associated with a serum profile of secreted proteins in a general population

3) Association of genetic mutations found to be associated with thyroid phenotypes with genetic mutations found to be associated with gene expressions from GTEx project (eQTL) and with secreted protein abundance from INTERVAL project (pQTL)

    a) Several genetic variants previously associated with thyroid phenotypes are also associated with the secretion of proteins and ligands of two NK immunoreceptors, CD314, and CD158b

4)  Association of secreted protein abundance with AITD and heritability of protein abundance

    a) Increased levels of apoptosis-associated Caspase-2 and Interleukin-1Î±, positively associated with AITD
    
    b) about 50% of secreted protein abundance seems to be driven by only environmental factors, few protein abundance seems to be highly driven by genetic background
